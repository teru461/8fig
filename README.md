# 8fig Growth Platform: Fast Flexible Funding for eCommerce Sellers, AI-Powered Cash Flow Management, Scale 4X Faster

So you're running an eCommerce business. You know that feeling when you've got a product that's selling like crazy, but you're stuck because you don't have enough cash to restock? Yeah, that's the inventory cash flow trap that basically every online seller faces at some point.

Here's the thing though—traditional bank loans aren't exactly built for how eCommerce actually works. Banks want collateral, credit checks, and they give you one big lump sum that you have to pay back on their schedule, not yours. Which is kind of ridiculous when your business needs cash in waves, tied to your supply chain rhythm.

That's where 8fig comes in. They're not trying to be your bank. They're trying to be your growth partner.

## What Exactly Is 8fig?

8fig is a funding and financial planning platform built specifically for eCommerce sellers. Founded in 2020 by a team that actually understands supply chains and online selling, they've already delivered over $500 million in funding to online sellers.

The basic idea is pretty straightforward: instead of getting one big loan and figuring out how to manage it yourself, 8fig gives you continuous cash injections aligned with your supply chain needs. They call it a "Growth Plan," and it's customized to your specific business.

Think of it less like borrowing money and more like having a CFO who actually understands eCommerce and can fund your growth at exactly the right moments.

## How Does 8fig Actually Work?

The process is surprisingly simple for something that sounds complex:

**Step 1: Quick Application**

You answer some basic questions about your business. No credit check, no mountains of paperwork. They just want to understand your sales history and supply chain.

**Step 2: Connect Your Store and Bank**

8fig integrates directly with platforms like Shopify, Amazon, eBay, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and Wix. This lets their AI analyze your actual business performance without you having to manually enter data.

**Step 3: Get Your Custom Growth Plan**

Within 24 hours to 2 days, you get a personalized funding offer. This isn't a cookie-cutter package—it's built around your specific needs, supply chain timing, and growth goals.

**Step 4: Receive Funding in Waves**

Instead of one lump sum, you get continuous capital injections when you actually need them—whether that's for inventory orders, marketing campaigns, or freight costs.

## What Makes 8fig Different From Other Funding Options?

### No Equity Required

You keep 100% ownership of your business. Unlike venture capital or angel investors, 8fig doesn't want a piece of your company. You're not giving up control or decision-making power.

### No Credit Check

Your personal credit score doesn't matter here. 8fig looks at your business performance—sales history, revenue trends, supply chain health. If your business is doing well, you're likely eligible.

### Flexible and Adjustable

Here's what's actually cool: if your sales slow down or speed up, you can adjust your funding and repayment schedule in real-time through the platform. You're not locked into rigid terms that don't match your actual cash flow.

### Continuous Funding Model

Most loans give you everything upfront, which means you pay interest on money you're not even using yet. 8fig's continuous model means you only pay for capital as you actually receive and use it.

## The Cost: How Much Does 8fig Actually Cost?

Let's talk money, because this is what everyone wants to know.

8fig doesn't charge traditional interest. Instead, they use a fixed "Cost of Capital" fee. Here's how it breaks down:

| Funding Amount | Cost of Capital Fee | Total Repayment | Effective Cost |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| $100,000 | $6,000 - $10,000 | $106,000 - $110,000 | 6% - 10% |
| $50,000 | $3,000 - $5,000 | $53,000 - $55,000 | 6% - 10% |
| $200,000 | $12,000 - $20,000 | $212,000 - $220,000 | 6% - 10% |

**What determines where you fall in that 6-10% range?**

It depends on your business profile—revenue history, supply chain structure, sales projections, and risk factors. But the key thing is: it's fixed and transparent from the start. You know exactly what you'll pay before you sign anything.

**No hidden fees.** No origination fees, no processing fees, no maintenance costs. Just the Cost of Capital fee.

## Who's Eligible for 8fig Funding?

The requirements are actually pretty reasonable:

✅ **Location**: United States or Canada (excluding Quebec)  
✅ **Business Age**: At least 12 months of operation  
✅ **Annual Revenue**: Minimum $100,000 per year  
✅ **Monthly Revenue**: Average of $8,000+ per month over the last 3 months  
✅ **Platform**: Selling on Amazon, Shopify, eBay, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Wix, or similar platforms

That's it. No personal guarantees, no collateral, no equity.

## Beyond Funding: 8fig's Free Planning Tools

Here's something most people don't realize—8fig isn't just about money. They've built a whole suite of free financial planning tools that you can use even if you don't take their funding:

### AI-Powered Sales Forecasting
Analyzes your sales patterns and seasonality to predict future revenue. Helps you plan inventory orders with actual data instead of guesswork.

### Restock Planner
Tells you exactly when to reorder products and how many units you need to avoid stockouts (without overstocking and tying up cash).

### Cash Flow Planner
Shows you exactly how much money you'll have on each day of the month, so you can plan expenses and avoid surprises.

### Supply Chain Mapping
Visual dashboard that maps out your entire supply chain—from deposits to freight to marketing—with line-by-line tracking of each product batch.

All of these tools are free, whether you use 8fig's funding or not.

## What Real Users Are Saying

The reviews are mixed, which is actually more helpful than all glowing testimonials (those always feel fake anyway).

### The Positive Experiences

Many sellers genuinely love 8fig. Common themes from positive reviews:

- **Fast funding**: Multiple users mention getting capital in just a few days
- **Helpful support team**: Names like Juan, Tanner, and Ryan come up repeatedly as being patient and responsive
- **Easy integration**: Shopify and Amazon sellers appreciate how smoothly their stores connect
- **Flexible adjustments**: The ability to modify funding schedules when circumstances change is a game-changer for many
- **No credit impact**: Users love that the application doesn't affect their credit score

One seller on Trustpilot shared: *"This is my 2nd business that I work with 8fig. They are an INCREDIBLE partner. They give small businesses like ours a hand up. Affordable pricing, generous but accurate capital amounts, extremely friendly staff."*

Another wrote: *"8fig has been a lifeline for us. We now have peace of mind that our products are going to continue to grow and cash isn't going to be a limit for us."*

### The Challenging Experiences

Not everyone has a smooth ride, and it's important to know what can go wrong:

- **Aggressive remittance schedules**: Some sellers find the repayment schedule too demanding for their cash flow
- **Last-minute funding cancellations**: A few users report having funding approved and then pulled at the last minute
- **Communication issues**: Some sellers struggled to get timely responses during critical decision points
- **UI complexity**: Several users mention the dashboard could be more intuitive
- **Technical glitches**: A handful of complaints about platform or app issues

One frustrated user on BBB wrote about their funding being cancelled without warning right before it was supposed to be finalized, causing operational problems.

The honest truth? Like any financial service, experiences vary. The platform works great for many sellers, but it's not perfect for everyone.

## 8fig vs Traditional Funding Options

Let's put this in perspective:

| Feature | 8fig | Bank Loans | Venture Capital | Merchant Cash Advance |
|---------|------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Equity Required** | No | No | Yes (significant) | No |
| **Credit Check** | No | Yes | Sometimes | Minimal |
| **Funding Speed** | 1-3 days | Weeks to months | Months | 1-3 days |
| **Repayment** | Flexible schedule | Fixed monthly | No repayment | Daily/weekly % |
| **Cost** | 6-10% fixed | 5-15% APR | Equity stake | 15-50%+ effective |
| **Funding Amount** | Up to 90% supply chain | Fixed limit | Variable | Usually limited |
| **Adjustability** | High | None | N/A | Low |

The continuous funding model really stands out here. You're not paying interest on money sitting unused in your account.

## The AI CFO Technology

8fig markets their proprietary "AI CFO" pretty heavily. What does that actually mean?

Basically, their system analyzes:
- Your sales trends and seasonality
- Supply chain timing and costs
- Cash flow gaps
- Inventory needs
- Revenue predictions

Then it automatically creates funding schedules that match when you actually need money. It's not some generic algorithm—it's customized to your specific business patterns.

Is it perfect? No AI is. But for supply chain forecasting and cash flow management, it's legitimately helpful according to most user reviews.

## Recent Developments: $140M Series B Funding

In 2023, 8fig raised $140 million in Series B funding, bringing their total funding to nearly $200 million. This was during a period when a lot of fintech companies were struggling.

What does this mean for users? More financial stability, more resources to improve the platform, and expanded features like:
- Mobile app for managing funding on the go
- Freight management and payment features
- Enhanced financial prediction models
- Banking solutions (coming)

## Is 8fig Right for Your Business?

**8fig is probably a good fit if:**
- You're an established eCommerce seller with consistent sales
- You need flexible funding tied to your supply chain rhythm, not arbitrary bank schedules
- You want to keep full ownership and don't want to give up equity
- You're selling on major platforms like Amazon, Shopify, or BigCommerce
- You need both funding AND financial planning tools

**8fig might not be ideal if:**
- Your business is brand new (under 12 months)
- Your monthly revenue is inconsistent or below $8,000
- You're not comfortable with aggressive repayment schedules during growth phases
- You need a massive lump sum immediately
- You prefer traditional banking relationships

## How to Get Started with 8fig

Ready to explore what 8fig can offer your business? The process is straightforward:

1. **👉 [Visit 8fig's platform](https://www.8fig.co)** and click on the funding assessment
2. Answer basic questions about your business and supply chain
3. Connect your eCommerce store and bank account securely
4. Review your personalized Growth Plan offer
5. Accept the terms if it works for your business
6. Receive funding within days

The application takes about 10-15 minutes, and you'll know within 1-2 days whether you're approved and what your terms would be.

## The Bottom Line

8fig is tackling a real problem that eCommerce sellers face: the mismatch between how traditional financing works and how online businesses actually operate.

Is it perfect? No. Some sellers have had frustrating experiences, especially around communication and funding cancellations. The remittance schedules can be aggressive, and not everyone loves the platform interface.

But for many sellers—especially those doing six figures or more in annual revenue who need flexible, continuous funding tied to their supply chain—8fig offers something genuinely different from traditional banks or VC investors.

The 6-10% cost of capital is reasonable compared to merchant cash advances (which can hit 50%+ effective rates) and venture capital (which takes equity). The no-credit-check, no-equity-required approach opens doors for sellers who might not qualify for traditional financing.

Plus, the free financial tools are legitimately useful even if you never take a dollar of funding.

At the end of the day, whether 8fig is right for you depends on your specific situation. But if you're tired of cash flow headaches holding back your eCommerce growth, it's definitely worth exploring what they can offer.
